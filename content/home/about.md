# Biography

Devika Nair is a recent graduate of the MS Data Analytics program within American
University's Kogod School of Business. After completing her BS in Neuroscience at
Franklin & Marshall College, she worked at Genetic Alliance, a nonprofit dedicated
to advocacy on behalf of communities affected by genetic conditions.

About a year later, she shifted into the healthcare world, working for The Advisory
Board Company, first in an executive support role and later as a business analyst for
the company's internal Salesforce development team.

During the pursuit of her graduate degree, she pivoted from healthcare IT into local
government, serving Arlington County's new Process & Data Analysis team. After a
year there, she now studies applied data science through Virginia Tech's Data Science
for Public Good summer program.
